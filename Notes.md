## Indian Sign Language to text and speech conversion

HathSayBaat is a tool which helps the deaf and the hard-of-hearing community to translate their sign language into text and speech forms. It'll allow then to communicate better and removes the barrier to know sign language to understand and talk to the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
